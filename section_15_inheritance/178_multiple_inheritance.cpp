                                    Multiple Inheritance


                - A derived class inherits from two or more
                    base classes at the same time

                - The base classes may belong to unrelated class hierarchies


                - a department chair
                    - is-a faculty 
                    - is-a administrator



            C++ Syntax



            class Department_Chair:
                public Faculty, public Administrator {
                    . . .
            };


            - Beyond the scope of this course
            - some compelling use-cases
            - easily misused
            - can be very complex
