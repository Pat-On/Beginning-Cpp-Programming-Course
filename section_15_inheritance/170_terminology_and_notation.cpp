                Terminology and Notation

        - inheritance
            - process of creating a new class from existing classes
            - reuse mechanism
        - single inheritance
            - a new class in created from another single class
        - multiple inheritance 
            -a new class is created from two (or more) other classes

    ----------------------------------------------------------

        Base class (parent class, super class)
            - the class being extended or inherited from
        
        Derived class (child class, sub class)
            - the class being created from the base class
            - will inherit attributes and operation from base class


    -----------------------------------------------------------

        "Is-A" relationship
            - public inheritance
            - derived classes are sub-types of their base classes
            - can use a derived class object wherever we use a base class object

        - generalization
            - combining similar classes into a single, more general class based on common attributes

        - specialization
            - creating new classes from existing classes proving more specialized attributes or operations
        
        - inheritance or class hierarchies 
            - organization of our inheritance relationships
