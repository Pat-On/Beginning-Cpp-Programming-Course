    Smart Pointers
    - issues with raw pointers
    - what are smart pointers?
    - concepts of ownership and RAII
    - C++ Smart Pointers
        - Unique pointers (unique_prt)
        - Shared pointers (shared_ptr)
        - Weak pointers (weak_ptr)
    - Custom deleters



    Summary:

    when to use:
        use unique_ptr wherever you can
        use share_ptr when you have more complex object management semantics
