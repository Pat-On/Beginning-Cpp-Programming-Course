/*

            Some issues with raw pointers

    - C++ provides absolute flexibility with memory management
        - allocation
        - deallocation
        - lifetime management
    
    - Some potentially serious problems
        - Uninitialized (wild) pointers
        - memory leaks
        - dangling pointers
        - not exception safe
    
    - ownership 
        - who owns the pointer?
        - when should a pointer be deleted
