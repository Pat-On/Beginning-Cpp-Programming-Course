/*

                ?:


        (cond_expr) ? expr1 : expr2

- cond_expr evaluates to a boolean expression
    - if cond_expr is true then the value of expr1 is returned
    - if cond_expr is false then the value of expr2 is returned 

- similar to if-else construct
- ternary operator
- very useful when used inline
- very easy to abuse!
