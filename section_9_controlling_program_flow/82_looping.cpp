        Looping

    - the third basic building block of programming
        - sequence
        - selection
        - iteration
    - iteration or repetition
    - allows the execution of a statement or block of statements repeatedly
    - loops are mede up a loop condition and they body which contains the statements to repeat

        ------------------------------------------------------------------

    Some typical use-cases

    execute a loop:
        - a specific number of times
        - for each element in a collection
        - while a specific condition remains true
        - until a specific condition becomes false
        - until we reach the end of some input stream
        - forever 
        - many, many more 


        ------------------------------------------------------------------

    - for loop
        - iterate a specific number of times

    - range-based for loop
        - one iteration for each element in a range or collection

    - while loop
        - iterate while a condition remains true
        - stop when the condition becomes false
        - check the condition at the beginning of every iteration

    - do- while loop
        - iterate while a condition remains true
        - stop when the condition becomes false
        - check the condition at the end of every iteration
