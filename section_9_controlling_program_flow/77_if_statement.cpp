/*

        if (expr)
            statement
    
    - if the expression is true then execute the statement
    - if the expression is false then skip the statement

    example:

    if (selection === 'A') 
        cout << "You selected A";


    ---------------------------------------

    Block statement

        {
            //variable declarations
            statement1;
            statement2;
            ...
        }

    - create a block of code by including more than one statement in code block {}
    - blocks can also contain variable declarations
    - these variables are visible only within the block - local scope
