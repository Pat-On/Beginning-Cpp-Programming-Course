    What is Object-Oriented Programming?

    - Procedural Programming
    - Procedural Programming limitations

    - OO Programming concepts and their advantages
    - OO Programming limitations

    ---------------------------------

    Procedural Programming
    - Focus is on processes or actions that a program takes
    - programs are typically a collection of functions
    - data is declared separately
    - data is passed as arguments into functions
    - fairly easy to learn

    Procedural Programming - Limitations

    - Functions need to know the structure of the data
        - if the structure of the data changes many functions must be changed

    - as programs get larger they become more:
        - difficult to understand
        - difficult to maintain
        - difficult to extend
        - difficult to debug
        - difficult to reuse code
        - fragile and easier to break


    ---------------------------------

    What is OOP?

    - Classes and Objects
        - focus is on classes that model real-world domain entities
        - allows developers to think at a higher level of abstraction
        - used successfully in very large programs

    - Encapsulation
        - objects contain data AND operations that work on that data
        - Abstract Data Type (ADT)

    - Information-hiding
        - implementation-specific logic can be hidden
        - users of the class code to the interface since they do not need to know the implementation
        - more abstraction
        - easier to test, debug, maintain and extend

    - Reusability
        - easier to reuse classes in other applications
        - faster development
        - higher quality

    - Inheritance
        - can create new classes in term of existing classes
        - reusability
        - polymorphic classes

    - Polymorphism and more...

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                LIMITATIONS

    - Not a panacea
        - OO Programming would not make bad code better
        - not suitable for all types of problems
        - not everything decomposes to class

    - learning curve
        - usually a steeper leaning curve, especially for C++
        - many OO languages, many variation of OO concepts

    - design
        - usually more up-front design is necessary to create good models and hierarchies

    - Programs can be
        - larger in size
        - slower
        - more complex
